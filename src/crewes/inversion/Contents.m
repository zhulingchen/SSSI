% The CREWES Inversion toolbox
%
% two different 1-D inversions schemes, band limited integration,
% computing Rcs from impedance and the reverse.
%
% blimp   - Band limited impendance inversion
% blint   - Band limited integration
% imp2rcs - Given impendance, compute RC's
% mergetrcs - Merge two seismic traces in the frequency domain (used by
%              blimb)
% rcs2imp - Given RC's, compute impendance
% rcs2imp_r - Recusive integration of RC's
